      "quote": "Introduced by Google in 2015, Progressive Webs Apps, PWAs, are apps that offer a native app-like feel to web applications that are designed to work cross-platform. These offer features like offline capability, local caching of assets, push notifications, and performance benefits. Technically speaking, a web app must have three main components for us to call it a progressive web app.",

      "quote": "Unlike websites and web applications, native mobile apps don’t run in the browser. You need to download them from platform-specific app stores such as Apple’s App Store and Google Play. After installation, you can access each app by tapping its respective icon on the screen of your device. Native app development requires different skills and technologies than mobile website development. You don’t have to worry about browser behavior and compatibility. You can use the native features of mobile OSs to deliver the user experience and implement the functionalities of your app.",
